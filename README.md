First thing in mind is, What is java program? 

A Java program is a set of instructions written in the Java programming language to perform a specific task. Java programs are usually written in .java files using a class-based structure. Each program must contain at least one class, and the starting point is the main method. The code is compiled by the Java compiler (javac) into bytecode, which is then run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This allows the program to be platform-independent. Java programs can be as simple as printing text or as complex as building large-scale web applications. They follow object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Java programs use standard libraries for tasks like file handling, networking, and GUIs. Developers commonly write Java programs in IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. Overall, Java programs are known for their portability, readability, and reliability.
